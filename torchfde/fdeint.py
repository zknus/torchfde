    """Integrate a system of ordinary differential equations.

      Solves the initial value problem for a non-stiff system of first order ODEs:
          ```
          D^(\beta)_t = func(t, y), y(t[0]) = y0
          ```
      where y is a Tensor or tuple of Tensors of any shape.

      Output dtypes and numerical precision are based on the dtypes of the inputs `y0`.

      Args:
          func: Function that maps a scalar Tensor `t` and a Tensor holding the state `y`
              into a Tensor of state derivatives with respect to time. Optionally, `y`
              can also be a tuple of Tensors.
          y0: N-D Tensor giving starting value of `y` at time point `t[0]`. Optionally, `y0`
              can also be a tuple of Tensors.
          t: float torch tensor,the integrate terminate time. the default initial time point is set as 0.
          step_size: float torch tensor, the step size of the integrate method.
          method: optional string indicating the integration method to use.
          options: optional dict of configuring options for the indicated integration
              method. Can only be provided if a `method` is explicitly set.
      Returns:
          y: Tensor, where the first dimension corresponds to different
              time points. Contains the solved value of y for each desired time point in
              `t`, with the initial value `y0` being the first element along the first
              dimension.

      Raises:
          ValueError: if an invalid `method` is provided.
